# The Open Source domain - What's in it?

## Purpose of this document

This document serves to level the understanding and playing field between technical (software engineering), non-technical (domain, business) and legal people to enable cross-domain collaboration.
It also serves to provide a common terminology and level up people without an Open Source background to enable them to discuss basic to intermediate topics of Open Source.

Everything until "3 Modes of Open Source" a high-level intuition and definition of important technical terms in a least technical explanation. 
These terms are required to understand and act upon the later sections.

"3 Modes of Open Source" defines the most common modes of Engagement seen in Open Source. It provides definition and intuition about open source domain specific terms.
These terms are required to understand and act upon the later sections.

"FOSS licenses" defines common use and expectations towards "Open Source licenses" and what areas they govern and which not.
It also briefly discusses common aspects that are not covered by "FOSS licenses" but are regarded belonging to "FOSS governance".
It builds upon the previously defined terms.

"Responsibilities and Expectations" builds upon the previous sections to define actionable items and suggests possible priorization to enable the creation of "canned decisions" (i.e. FOSS policy) to be re-used by management, domain experts and software engineers.
It also sets expectations what to expect from Open Source in the narrower sense and what not.

The last sections address - as much as they're known - possible specialties arising from the public sector and TSO environment.
These sections and the "Responsibilities and Expectations" also highlight boundaries between publishers and users/contributors.

FOSS strategy leads over to the separate FOSS strategy document connecting it to some of the aspects in the previous sections.


## How to work with it

Depending on your education and role it might be possible to only skim over certain sections you may have sufficient knowledge in. 
For a software engineer this likely is everything until "3 modes of Open Source".

Important terms in the pre-requisite terms section are marked, hyperlinked and re-used in later sections.

Usage of the "Responsibilities and Expectations" section requires domain and technical term knowledge - be it from the document or own expertise. Binding definitions are in the document.

The are many work items in the "Responsibilities and Expectations" section.
A practical proposal ist to separate them into individual tasks, address them bit by bit and store resulting knowledge and decisions as individual files next to this guideline. It is also recommended to use the terms in this guideline in the resulting knowledge and decision documents to enable intersubjective understanding.


## Disclaimer

None of the following content in this or the hyperlinked documents is legal advice or to be interpreted as such. 

The following introduces certain aspects of the Open Source (and, based on the work approaches introduced by Open Source, by that InnerSource) domain to further understanding of terms and field.

It raises, without being exhaustive or complete, certain questions around common risk items that are brought up for further legal analysis. Any risk parts are to be interpreted as question around possible risk to be analyzed and cleared up not statement of fact.

It further explains select technical matter in a strongly abstracted and simplified manner. Due to this abstraction, the information may not be suitable to fully decide certain specific legal situations. Detailed technical explanation and analysis is likely to be required in practical application. 

Any examples used are hypothetical and strongly simplified to provide an intuition of the matter explained.

The information is based on experience, common risk items being brought up in a German or US context, as well as information provided by the Danish digitalization agency in the [legal analysis document]().

Interpretation ans risk can significantly differ in Danish law and thus detailed legal analysis of the topics and possible resulting follow-up topics is strongly recommended. See [IT Retten]() book.

It is strictly recommended to seek advice from a FOSS specialized lawyer prior to consuming, deploying, publishing, or participating in Open Source or doing the same with commercial software using or embedding any Open Source component.

Authors notice: The consultancy mandate does not include legal advice, FOSS compliance consulting or advice on FOSS publication beyond technical, ways-of-working and common domain expectations. Any further advice, especially of legal nature, implicit or explicit, needs to be sourced from the relevant partners, e.g. a specialized lawyer.
