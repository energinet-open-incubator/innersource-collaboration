# Good principles underlying many FOSS participants expectations
(As always: Not complete and growing list)

- Build trust: - Nobody should feel taken advantage of - Always know what they're trading / are in for.  
- Always be as transparent as possible and do explicit expectation management  .
- If you have different "hats" (roles/responsibilities, fx corporate vs. foundation): Make it clear which hat you're wearing and try to not cause conflicts of interest  
- Build trust through reliability:  Try to create a consistent appearance / behavior of a FOSS project over time  
- If it's FOSS: Try to set common interest first, corporate interest second and make it explicit where's what (cooperative / Genossenschaft in approach)
