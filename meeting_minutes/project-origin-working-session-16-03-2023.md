# Notes

## Attendees:
- Just put their names in one line here.

## Key Points:
**Project Origin Backlog**
- In Progress:
    - [#72](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/72) _go through licensing_: @lauranolling has not reached out yet. Will be moved to waiting.
    - [#180](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/180) _Create project-origin-working-session-16-03-2023.md_: This PR.

- Waiting/Blocked:
    - [#71](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/71) _success criteria_: the MoU in in proceedings, says @wisbech. The group changes "media training" to "media awareness".
    - [#68](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/68) _shared narrative_: @wisbech adds comment. He is working on slide-deck, and has worked with Concordium on a paper. @lauranolling, @NicolasENDK and @wisbech worked on Project-Origin overview, @wisbech created a new issue [#179](https://github.com/project-origin/registry/issues/96) to finish this document. @wisbech argues that the purpose of this issue has evolved quite a bit, now also targeted outwards toward interested stakeholders. @wisbech will make a new comment here (See [Assignments]).
  
    
**Collaboration Platform Backlog** 
- In Progress:
    - [#79](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/79) _Contribution Guidelines_: Almost done, @lauranolling will add a comment on what is missing (see [Assignments]). 
    
- Waiting/Blocked:
    - [#129](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/129) _Landing Page_: License still missing, but someone ordered 50 Github licenses, but we don't know who ordered them.


**Energinet Open Incubator Backlog**
- **Note**: We did not make it all the way through these. 

- In Progress:
    - [#15](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/incubator-open-source-ressources/issues/15) _Migrate Project-Origin content_: Related to assignment from last weekly. @lauranolling has moved content, but does not get commit history as @lenucksi expected would follow when copying over. @lenucksi will take a look (see [Assignments]). 
    
- Waiting/Blocked:

    

**Additional notes**
- The group briefly discusses Open Incubator in terms of open ways of working and working with projects/project life cycles. @wisbech refers @andersfausboll to Morten Jokumsen @guidmaster, as he is currently working on a related paper on projects creation and life cycles, arguing that the important part of organizing should depend on projects and not teams. 
   - Focus on measuring points in stead of on the value creation 
- Discussion Project Portfolio Management
   - @wisbech mentions Rasmus Knappe from Microsoft to discuss the topics of Energinet Open Incubator. (Maybe we should add a comment in the issue?). A way to bring forward what is actually going on in the organization. 
   - @lauranolling mentions an e-mail she got from the PMO department looking for a graduate. The groups agree that she will reply, referring to Open Incubator and @andersfausboll (See [Assignments]). @wisbech suggests to approach her with questions and letting her make decisions. Let her define roles and tasks for herself. 
   - @wisbech mentions that ENDK has encountered some issues in making projects open, then closed again, for unknown reasons - may point to that the open source policies and strategies are not well-defined. 
   - @lenucksi argues that the important parts in project portfolio management are assigning priorities to projects and learning the ways of working. 
- @wisbech mentions that Project-Origin currently achieves lots of attention, from FEA, Elia Group, EnergyTag. 
   - @lenucksi points to considering a Community manager to handle communications/marketing line in Github. However, would create a bad separation 
- The group agreed that @andersfausboll will need some inputs from @lauranolling before she moves to another department, on how to act as trusted committer in the open-incubator repo. 
- The group agrees to move meeting minutes to the Open Incubator org instead of Project-Origin. 

## Assignments
