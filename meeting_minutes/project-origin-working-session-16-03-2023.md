# Notes

## Attendees:
- Just put their names in one line here.

## Key Points:
- Put them here, One point per line
  - What to put here: If there's something longer: Point to the GitHub issue. If there's a pre-existing GitHub issue, point to the GitHub issue and state that/what some happened there. Often, just the issue and little words suffice, put the "what happened"/ "update" onto the actual issue. 
    - Same obviously goes for discussions and pull requests.
    - Pointing can happen either with a link or with #thenumberofthethinginquestion.
  - If there's something un-githubbable, put some words here. You can refer to any persons involved by their GitHub handles if that helps getting the situation forward.

## Assignments
Put assignments here in the following format: 

- The person's name+GitHub handle  that agreed to do it
  - Put the assignments for that person here. Only one assignment  per line.
