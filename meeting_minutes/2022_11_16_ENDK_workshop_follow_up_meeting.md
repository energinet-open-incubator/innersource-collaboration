# Internal Meeting at Energinet 16-11-2022 - Follow-up on the Workshop
These are meeting minutes following up on agreements made in the workshop
## Summary of workshop outcomes
### Talk 1 from the workshop
- Energy Track and Trace and Energy Origin, it has become clear that some of the core functionality requires:
  - Trustworthiness
  - Transparency
  - Protected data
 
 -> Highly technical core. Project Origin born
 
### Talk 2 from the workshop
- To obtain value creation, we need to organize ourselves and orchestrate efforts to reach value creation. Good organization includes:
  - easy onboarding
  - Documented decisions
  - A welcoming Github organization, comfortable and easy to work in
  
 -> RFCs are one example of a framework that can help obtain this. 

### Next steps agreed on in the workshop
- Define shared narrative and vision
- Start working on succes criteria
- Decide what to put on Github 
  - In the open, 
  - In the private repo
  - Decide how to address this underway
- Decide on organization and work structures in this project
- Obtain value propositions from each company 
- Start putting things into Github
- Clean up Github for easier overview


## Since the workshop
A project board has been created in Github, in the origin-collaboration repo, called internal backlog, where follow-up tasks are added. The board can be shown in different views, as a KANBAN board, or as a list sorted by priority.  

### Decisions on project board
- Drafts must be converted to issues
- One person will be the owner of the item, but several can be assigned as referees
- Project Origins will sign up for the waitlist on the extended Github Projects functionalities

#### Comments:
- There are other project boards as well, and there may be some duplicates. These must be sorted out
- Some of the items seem to be more related to open source/innersource in Energinet. Those should be moved to somewhere else
  - The item "Coordinate with general open source work in Energinet" may still be relevant though. 


### Project-Origins in connection to DataHub and Energy Track and Trace
In ETT an initiative is started, meant to provide better coordination of efforts across projects. A wish has been expressed to also keep Project Origin as a part of this coordination effort.
