# Notes

## Attendees:
-  Thomas / @wisbech, Johannes / @lenucksi, Anders / @andersfausboll and Laura / @lauranolling 

## Key Points:

**Project Origin Backlog**
- In Progress:
    - [#67](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/67/) _Division Project Origin and Open Incubator_: @andersfausboll will try to finish this by Monday
    - [#72](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/72/) _Go through licensing_: @lauranolling talked to cyber-security, will set up some conversations. @wisbech put a comment in the issue.
    - [#179](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/pull/179/) _This working session pull request_. 

 
- Waiting/Blocked:
    - [#71](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/71/) _Define success criteria_: Possibly,@mariaepelch is on it, but they are traveling next week, so not expecting progress here.
        -  A discussion arises on the communications aspect of Project-Origin. 
            - @lauranolling finds it crucial getting the communications part for Project-Origin straight. 
            - @lenucksi recommends making a contract between partners on closed/private part of Github: Who does what? Who owns what? Who gets what? Which needs spending more time defining: What is the product? where is the separation? What is the BC part and what is not? The group did not agree on any specific assignments or assignees to do so. 
    - [#68](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/68/) _Shared Narrative_: We didn't discuss this issue, but @lauranollings opinion here is that we should move to "In Progress" and give @MortenHouborg, @wisbech and @NicolasENDK some credit here, as they are working on this. 
    
**Collaboration Platform Backlog** 
- In Progress:
    - [#109](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/109) _Beginners guides_: @lauranolling  is working on it.
    [#79](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/79) _Contribution Guidelines_: @lauranolling says that this is almost done.

- Waiting/Blocked:
    - [#129](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/129) _Create landing page_: @lauranolling will work on both generic (Open Incubator) parts and Project-Origin parts. 
        - @wisbech suggests using Github's own docs for help, @lenucksi and @andersfausboll argues that a lot of work is also targeted the audience and needs identified in Project-Origin which has required customizations. 
        - Still waiting for license, work in progress on getting there though, according to @wisbech 

**Energinet Open Incubator Backlog**
We are going to the new project board at the [Open Incubator organization](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator). @lauranolling asks everyone to double check if everything is in place (See [Assignments]). @lauranolling then to remove Incubator content in Project-Origin (See [Assignments]).

- In Progress:
    - [#15](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/incubator-collaboration/issues/15) _Contact new PMO_: @andersfausboll will take a look as soon as possible.
    - [#14](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/incubator-collaboration/issues/14) _Scoping Open Incubator_: WIP still, didn't catch if @wisbech is done reviewing? What still needs to be done here? 
    - [#5](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/incubator-collaboration/issues/5) _Beginners guides_: Same as for Project-Origin, but probably more generically usable in ENDK.
        - @wisbech suggests trying out text-to-video synthesizers 
    - [#16](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/incubator-collaboration/issues/16) _Set up Incubator org_: We decide having one Enterprise license covering both Project-Origin and Open Incubator, hence some more moving of content is necessary (See [Assignments])
    - [#17](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/incubator-collaboration/issues/16) _Migrate content from Project-Origin to Open-Incubator_: @lenucksi suggests duplicating repo from Project-Origin to Incubator. @lauranolling and @andersfausboll to look at it Monday (See [Assignments])
    
- Waiting/Blocked:
    - 
    

**Additional notes**
- The group discusses communication around open collaborations and open source in ENDK in general. 
    - @lenucksi highlights the aspect of diplomacy as an important priority when working in open source, to gain more control of risks in communications and press. He recommends training, especially to the outward faces of OS projects, but ideally to everyone who commits publicly, as they are representatives of ENDK in the OS world. 
    - @wisbech points out that actually, for all press releases´, the communications department must be informed and get the option to provide inputs. We didn't do that with Version2 article and currently get some backlash for that. However there is a deadlink in guide on InSite. @wisbech to follow up on this himself (See the [Assignments] section).  Gives the perception that ENDK is not at all prepared for potential shit storms. 
    - @wisbech argues that this goes all the way back to innovation: How do we plan to deal with this?  We need a more pro-active approach to this. We need some general guidelines on how to behave in public. 
     - @wisbech comments: Can we even host projects like this, or should we ask internals to do it? @wisbech finds that there should ideally be a foundation to move it to. @lenucksi argues that the same problems will still exist with public behavior. Investigating this is suggested to be an effort living inside of Open Incubator. @andersfausboll created an issue in the [Open Incubator Github](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/incubator-collaboration/issues/19) addressing the communications problem 
    - @wisbech mentions the Danish Rigsrevision as the main issue here. @lenucksi recommends looking into: Transfer cost pricing. The group agrees that this should be discussed further in another meeting and moves along with the agenda.
