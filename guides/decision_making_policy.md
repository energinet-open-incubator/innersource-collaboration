# Decision-Making Policy 

This project’s work is mostly done asynchronously, where normal decision-making structures tend to be ineffective. Hence, we have set up this decision-making policy, to create some general guiding structures to follow, specifying when a suggestion or vote can be regarded as decided/done. 

This decision-making policy is mostly created as a collection of practices implemented, and will continually be modified to reflect what the community finds as best practices for making the project run smoothly. In some cases, a decisions will be made on something, that you wanted to have a say in as well. In such case, we are always open to new/alternative suggestions, following our [Contribution Guidelines](Link here). 

If you find that something in this policy could be improved, feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions) or [post an issue](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/new/choose), describing your suggestion(s). 

## Polls
Polls posted in the [Discussion forum](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions), will include a description of the different options, and possibly an answering deadline (see the [Contribution Guidelines](link here) for more information). The decision-making in polls follows a lazy consensus approach, inspired by the Apache definition of the concept (Apache Community Development - Lazy Consensus). 

In Project-Origin the lazy consensus approach entails that silence, or not answering the poll, is consent to whatever gets most votes. If no votes are received, the [default option](contribution-guideline-link-here) will be chosen. This also means that, if you have any adjustment requests to the poll, you must actively provide your proposal. Likewise, you must propose an alternative to the poll, if you do not agree with the result, or if you don’t think the topic the result of a poll, you must actively propose an alternative.  

### Answering Timeframe
The answering deadline should be reasonable, to ensure that everyone has the chance to see and react on your poll. It is recommended to provide **a time frame on at least 10 working days** to allow for interaction and potentially discussion on/adjustment of the poll. 

#### Urgent decision-making
Sometimes it may happen that decision-making on a topic is urgent. In such case, make sure to tag anyone directly affected by the decision, and mark the poll with the label `urgent` (See the [Labels Contribution Guidelines](link here) for more information on labelling).

## Pull requests 
Everyone in the community can create pull requests, or add reviews, comments, and suggestions to others’ pull requests. The process for _merging_ pull requests follows the [InnerSource approach]( https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/guides/innersource-short-role-descriptions.md#what-is-the-working-process-using-the-three-roles), where the decision of which pull requests get merged belongs to the Product Owner and Trusted Committer. 
Time frame

To ensure quick merge turnarounds, the merging process for pull requests follows a [lazy consensus approach](link-here) as well, which means that not reacting to a pull request is interpreted as silent consent. However, to ensure code quality and consistency with the goals of Project-Origin, **a pull request can only be merged when it is approved by a [Trusted Committer/Maintainer](link-here)**.
