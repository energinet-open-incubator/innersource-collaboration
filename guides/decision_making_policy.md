# Decision-Making Policy 

This decision-making policy is mostly created as a collection of practices, reflecting what the community of Project-Origin finds as best practices for making the project run smoothly. Given that Project-Origin is a dynamic, evolving project, such practices will of course change over time. 
Hence, If you find that something in this policy could be improved or modified, feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions), describing your suggestion(s). 

In Project-Origin, work is mostly done asynchronously, where normal decision-making structures tend to be ineffective. 
Hence, we have set up this decision-making policy, to create some general guiding structures to follow, specifying when a suggestion or vote can be regarded as decided/done. 
The policy intent is to explicitly give the decision mandate to the community actively participating in the project. 

In some cases, this decision policy will lead to decisions being made, that you don't necessarily agree with. 
In such case, you can always pose an alternative suggestion, following our [Contribution Guidelines](Link here), for the community to adress. 
Of course this is not a guarantee that the community will agree with you.

In any case of interaction on the Project-Origin Github, we expect participants in the community to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/project-origin/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Polls
Polls will be posted in the [Discussion forum](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions).
The decision-making in polls follows a lazy consensus approach, inspired by the [Apache definition](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html) of the concept. 

If the poll doesn't follow the [Contribution Guidelines](link-here), the trus...

### Decision Criteria
- In Project-Origin the lazy consensus approach entails that silence, or not answering the poll, is consent to whatever gets most votes. 
- If no votes are received, the [default option](contribution-guideline-link-here) will be chosen.
- If two or more options get the same number of votes, the decision-mandate is given to the partners in the Project-Origin partnership.  
  - In the case where 

If you have any adjustment requests or comments to the poll, provide your feedback in the comment section on the poll. 
If you do not agree with the result of a poll, you must actively propose an alternative following our [Contribution Guidelines](link-here).  

### Answering Timeframe
The answering deadline should be reasonable, to ensure that the community has the chance to see and react on your poll. It is recommended to provide **a time frame on at least 10 working days** to allow for interaction and potentially discussion on and adjustment of the poll. 

#### Urgent decision-making
Sometimes it may happen that decision-making on a topic is urgent. In such case, make sure to tag anyone directly affected by the decision, and mark the poll with the label `urgent` (See the [Labels Contribution Guidelines](link here) for more information on labelling).

## Pull requests 
Everyone in the community can create pull requests, or add reviews, comments, and suggestions to othersâ€™ pull requests. The process for _merging_ pull requests follows the [InnerSource approach]( https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/guides/innersource-short-role-descriptions.md#what-is-the-working-process-using-the-three-roles), where the decision of which pull requests get merged belongs to the Product Owner and Trusted Committer. 
Time frame

To ensure quick merge turnarounds, the merging process for pull requests follows a [lazy consensus approach](link-here) as well, which means that not reacting to a pull request is interpreted as silent consent. However, to ensure code quality and consistency with the goals of Project-Origin, **a pull request can only be merged when it is approved by a [Trusted Committer/Maintainer](link-here)**.
