# Decision-Making Policy 

This decision-making policy is mostly created as a collection of practices, reflecting what the community of Project-Origin finds as best practices for making the project run smoothly. Given that Project-Origin is a dynamic, evolving project, such practices will of course change over time. 
Hence, If you find that something in this policy could be improved or modified, feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions), describing your suggestion(s). 

In Project-Origin, work is mostly done asynchronously, where normal decision-making structures tend to be ineffective. 
Hence, we have set up this decision-making policy, to create some general guiding structures to follow, specifying when a suggestion or vote can be regarded as decided/done. 
The policy intent is to explicitly give the decision mandate to the community actively participating in the project. 

In some cases, this decision policy will lead to decisions being made, that you don't necessarily agree with. 
In such case, you can always pose an alternative suggestion, following our [Contribution Guidelines](Link here), for the community to adress. 
Of course this is not a guarantee that the community will agree with you.

In any case of interaction on the Project-Origin Github, the founding partnership expects participants in the community to follow our [Contribution Guidelines](link-here) and behave according to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/project-origin/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If any violating behavior is encountered, the [Trusted Committer](link-here) has the the authority to require modifications and/or ultimately remove the violating content on behalf of the partnership.

## Issues
Everyone in the community can create issues or add comments and suggestions to others' issues posted here on Project-Origin. 
In Project-Origin, issues are meant for discussing specific, closed-form ideas or details of a project. For more details on the use of issues, see the [Contribution Guidelines](link-here). 

Generally, a decision on an issue is considered as made, when:
1. The community has had reasonable time to react and provide input to the issue
2. The issue is closed, with a concluding comment on the reason for closing the issue. The owner of the issue is responsible for providing such comment, and closing the issue, when a decision is made. 
3. If relevant, a pull request is created, documenting the decision, in a location that is easy to find.

Decision-making for issues depend on the type of issue, and will be elaborated for the different types of issues below:

### Task 
[//]: # (Note that this issue template isn't created yet!)
Decision-making mandate to the Contributor. If external inputs are necessary, mark the issue with the label `help wanted` and tag anyone you want inputs/feedback from. Anyone can provide their inputs to the issue if relevant. Any related PRs may require acceptance from the Trusted Committer. This will be addressed in the [Pull Requests](#pull-requests) section. 

#### Timeframe
If receiving inputs to your task is urgent, mark your issue with the labels `urgent` and `help wanted`, and tag anyone you need help from. However, please use these with consideration. 

### Feature Request
A Trusted Committer has approved a course of action discussed, or suggested in the issue. A PR is created. 

Ultimately, the Trusted Committer has the mandate to reject the course of action, if they deem the suggested feature not to serve the best for the project. 

### Bug Report
The community discusses how to solve the problem. When the community finds agreement on how to fix the bug, a PR is created. 

Ultimately, the Trusted Committer has the mandate to reject a suggested course of action, if it is deemed not to serve the best for the project. 

#### Timeframe
While bug reports are highly appreciated, don't expect someone to immediately fix the problem you reported, but expect to put some effort into fixing the problem yourself, if fixing it is urgent to you. 

### RFC
Everyone can submit an RFC. It is up to the partnership to approve an RFC. 


## Pull requests 
Everyone in the community can create pull requests, or add reviews, comments, and suggestions to othersâ€™ pull requests. The process for _merging_ pull requests follows the [InnerSource approach]( https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/guides/innersource-short-role-descriptions.md#what-is-the-working-process-using-the-three-roles), where the decision of which pull requests get merged belongs to the Trusted Committer. 

### Timeframe

To ensure quick merge turnarounds, the merging process for pull requests follows a [lazy consensus approach](link-here) as well, which means that not reacting to a pull request is interpreted as silent consent. However, to ensure code quality and consistency with the goals of Project-Origin, **a pull request can only be merged when it is approved by a [Trusted Committer/Maintainer](link-here)**.




## Discussions

### Announcements
Won't be used for decision-making, but can be used to announce, e.g., any decisions made in the partnership that may affect the community.

### Documentation Issues
Discussions on documentation issues will often result in a specific sugggestion for something to add to the existing documentation. In that case...

### General
A forum for open, informal discussion in the community. This forum won't include decision-making.

### Ideas
Open-ended discussion on ideas. If an idea evolves to a feature request, an issue can be created.  

### Polls
Polls will be posted in the [Discussion forum](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions).
The decision-making in polls follows a lazy consensus approach, inspired by the [Apache definition](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html) of the concept. The poll can have a status of _proposed_, _open_ or _closed_. When a poll is _closed_, the outcome of the vote can be considered as decided on. 

[//]: # (Poll - (how) can we attach statusses to these?)

#### Decision Criteria
- In Project-Origin the lazy consensus approach entails that silence, or not answering the poll, is consent to whatever gets most votes. 
- If no votes are received, the [default option](contribution-guideline-link-here) will be chosen.
- If two or more options get the same number of votes, the decision-mandate is given to the partners in the Project-Origin partnership. The partnership will then choose the decision they find as the In such case, the [Trusted Committer](link-here) will notify the community of the 
- If you have any adjustment requests or comments to the poll, provide your feedback in the comment section on the poll. 
- If you do not agree with the result of a poll, that is considered as closed, you must actively propose an alternative following our [Contribution Guidelines](link-here).  

#### Answering Timeframe
The answering deadline should be reasonable, to ensure that the community has the chance to see and react on your poll. It is recommended to provide **a voting time frame on at least 10 working days** from the date that the poll receives the _open_ status. This time frame allows for interaction and potentially discussion on and adjustment of the poll. 


**Urgent decision-making**

If you find that making a decision on your poll is urgent, make sure to label the poll as `urgent`, and tag anyone you know is directly affected by the decision. It is always up to the Trusted Committer to accept the poll, and convert its status to _open_.

The founding partnership behind Project-Origin can evaluate decision-making on a topic as urgent. In such cases, the partners can make a decision fast, to ensure the progress of Project-Origin. In such case, the [Trusted Committer](link-here) is responsible for documenting the decision made by the group, and to tag anyone directly affected by the decision.


### Q&A
The community member can mark something as an answer. If any task or feature request arises from the discussion post, an issue can be created for this. 

### Show and Tell 
Not used for decision-making, but rather as a place to highlight contributions you have made.
