# Origin-Collaboration
Hi there, and welcome! This is our private repository to work in, for all us members in the partnership between Mj√∏lner, Alesandra Institute, Concordium and Energinet.

The purpose of this repository is to create a space for us to build structures and processes to use in our collaboration and to get practice in digital, asynchronous collaboration, beyond software development. This repository contains documents and tasks that are directly related to our internal collaboration, which is why it is set to private. Everything specifically related to the software development, directly relevant to an open community is instead located in the open, public repository [registry](https://github.com/project-origin/registry). 

Below, some information and links are provided to help navigate around the repository, and to help you to start collaborating here on Github!

## Need any help? 
If you have a problem or if you cannot find certain information anywhere, you can ask a question in the [Q&A Discussion Forum](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions/categories/q-a). People, who may have the same problem, can then find help in your discussion post later on. Alternatively, reach out to this repository's Trusted Committer, [@lauranolling](mailto:lau@energinet.dk), who will get back to you as soon as possible.

## Work Structures 

### Asynchronous work structures
Please consult the following guidelines and policies for information about rules that apply for contribution and participation in the Origin-Collaboration repository. 

- [Decision-Making Policy](docs/guidelines/decision_making_policy.md) 
- [Contribution Guidelines](docs/guidelines/contribution_guidelines.md)
- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/project-origin/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

#### Trusted Committer
In the Origin-Collaboration repository, @lauranolling currently acts as the Trusted Committer. In this repository, the Trusted Committer is effectively a combination of the [InnerSource Trusted Committer and Product Owner](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/docs/introductory/innersource-short-role-descriptions.md). 

### Weekly Synchronous Sessions
A small working group in Energinet has found it valuable to have weekly meetings, synchronous sessions, where the group goes through open issues in Project-Origin. If any attendee wants to discuss a specific matter, they can add a point to the agenda of the upcoming session, and the group will address the matter then. 

Currently, the weekly synchronous sessions happen each Thursday at 10:00-11:00. If you want to participate in (one of) these sessions, reach out to [@lauranolling](mailto:lau@energinet.dk), who will add you to the calendar invitation. The agenda for the upcoming meeting will always be added as a [pull request](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/pulls). 

#### Meeting Minutes
If you are interested in the topics and progress of previous weekly synchronous sessions, you can take a look at [this folder](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/tree/main/meeting_minutes), where summaries for the meetings are uploaded.

### Synchronous Partner Meetings
Besides working on Github, the partnership carries out longer-duration physical partner meetings. These meetings are not fixed-date meetings, but will rather be planned when the partnership finds the need for one. So far, the partner meetings include workshops and implementer days. 

#### Workshops
The workshops treat both technical and business topics related to Project-Origin. These workshops are mostly used to do the bigger-picture long-term planning of Project-Origin. The results from the workshops will be available [here](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration-workshops). 

#### Implementer Days
Technically oriented partner meetings, where the implementation group meets physically, and goes through their progress, pull requests and related topics. Meeting minutes for the implementer days are available [here](https://github.com/project-origin/registry/tree/main/meeting_minutes).
