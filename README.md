# origin-collaboration
Hi there, and welcome! This is our private repository, which we have created as a place to build structures and processes to use in our collaboration and to get practice in digital, asynchronous collaboration. This repository contains documents and tasks that are directly related to our internal partner collaboration, which is why it is set to private. Everything related to the implementation of the registry functionality, or anything relevant to the open source community is instead located in the open, public repositories. 

Below, you will find some information we have provided to make it easier for you to get started collaborating here on Github!

# Resources
If this is your first time participating in a project on Github, we will recommend you to begin with the [Introductory Guides](#introductory-guides). If you have experience with Github and just want to know the guidelines for contributing in this collaboration, you can skip directly to the [Contribution Guidelines](#contribution-guidelines). 

## Introductory Guides
- [A guide on using Issues and issue trackers](guides/issue_trackers.md) 
- A guide on using the Projects views
- A small introductory document on FOSS product management: https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/FOSS-pm/introsuggestions-fosspm.md
- A matching (and growing) small document on some indicators of FOSS success: https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/FOSS-pm/FOSS-common-success-criteria.md 

## Contribution Guidelines
- If you find that something is missing that could be useful to include, we will encourage you to check if an [Issue](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues) has been created for that topic already, or make a suggestion yourself, by [Creating an Issue](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/new/choose).
 - If you find that there are too many isuses, try the [project board view]() or [filter them to exclude workshop items](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Aworkshop+) or [filter them to show only ones that need help now](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) 
- If you encounter an error, want to start a vote or discussion, want to post an announcement, or have an idea for something, you should start a discussion in the [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions) in the channel you deem most relevant for your input.  
- If you need help with something, that you cannot find information about anywhere, you can ask a question in the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions/10)(https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions/65).
- If you can't access something you think you should be able to access please reach out to @lauranolling, or write an e-mail to lau@energinet.dk.

 - Images of the board can be seen here: https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/tree/main/workshop-08.11.2022

### Content
- Once more collab infrastructure is set up, e.g. after [#64](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/64) is done, more content will be here.

- A useful issues filter showing everything but the workshop stickies: https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Aworkshop+ (i.e. all labels but the "workshop" label)
 
#### External Ressources
