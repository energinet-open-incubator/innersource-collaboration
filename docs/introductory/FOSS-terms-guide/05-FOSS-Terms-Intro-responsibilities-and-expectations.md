# Responsibilities, Expectations and Constraints 

As shown above, Open Source is a large domain, however with well defined sub-domains that are interlinked at certain points.

There are aspects that are technical, aspects that have a legal focus and aspects that are business strategy and some that border into international collaboration topics weakly reminding of UN style diplomacy.

Energinet needs to start *somewhere* to make it practical and enable ongoing evolution. 

We currently have:

- The Energinet incubator: Here, we focus on learning how to benefit from internal collaboration, InnerSource style. 
- Various FOSS and InnerSource product efforts run by different teams. 
  - [Energy Track & Trace](https://github.com/Energy-Track-and-Trace/)
  - [Datahub](https://github.com/energinet-datahub) <!-- Their GitHub org page or additional content they might have --> 
  - The [**awesome-energinet-open** portal/list](https://weneedalinkwherewecanhosthisvisibleforeveryenerginetpersonthatsalsosafeforsomesensitivecontent) serving as an easy starting point to these efforts.
  - Internal educational material as the one you're reading now.

- A longer horizon effort to build FOSS policy and understanding on a legal basis to ultimately help the products and everyone else.
  - A list of (currently mostly legal-oriented action points) can be seen [here](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/work-items/FOSS-terms-guide-action-items.md/). 
  - Once work progresses there, this section will contain some practical advice and links to address the topics of around liability, warranty, trademarks, patents, FOSS compliance etc. 


## Frontiers in Open Source

One goal of FOSS publication is to enable and facilitate collaboration with other organizations and people to create a greater common good that benefits everyone. However, the risk of the participating parties needs to be known, isolated and controlled, both for us and them. 

We should not be liable for the actions of others, i.e. what people do with our code must not be our problem. Thus boundaries need to be set and risks defined.

We can also not help other parties to understand and control their risks. We can only be as explicit and transparent in our expectations and intent as possible to allow other parties an informed decision on participation and adjusting their way and level of investment.

To enable such explicit expectations we need to have a clear understanding of our offerings and their strategy, i.e. product separation, definition and strategy. This guide does not deal with this. See the [strategy guide](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/docs/additional_reading/07-FOSS-Terms-Intro-FOSS-strategy.md) for this. For some aspects of FOSS governance see the previous section. However, don't do governance before there is product definition.

## Contribution of Open Source to Energinet as a company

Open Source acts as a de-facto standardized framework to simplify cross-company collaboration with boundaries and defined roles (often called "hats").

Our problem is to foresee and harden against certain unwanted competitive and reputation damage scenarios.  Our second challenge is explicit expectation management to limit public frustration and encourage informed participation.

What is the contribution of Open Source for us in a bit more detail?

### Collaboration
- Collaboration between corporate entities has - within very limited boundaries - been possible beforehand. 
- It did include extensive "red lining" and "lawfare" beforehand. 
- Open Source - by means of its standardized licenses and very well tried mechanisms of collaboration and reasonably working social contracts - allows to shorten the red lining process and while providing some more legal clarity and cleaner, more explicit expectation management.
- The above facilitates cross-country collaboration and collaboration with small entities such as private individuals.
- Investment in legal questions remains but moves from sometimes repetitive work to reusable decisions as cases become more standardized. Ideally this can make work more interesting :wink:

### Public value and Re-use

- Open Source allows to built a shared commons with defined liability and expectation scenarios
- This can then be re-used throughout various parties without extensive contract negotiations beforehand.
- This also allows third parties to take up work that has been abandoned by others but is considered to still contain value.
- Direct and detailed visibility of work approach, work results and ability to interact with those involved allows to build trust through review in what is created. This can be especially valuable for public bodies.
  - Corollary: It also is very (longtime) effective in nuking any trust that might have existed beforehand if done wrong. :popcorn:  
    - Often, if something published is morally debatable or connected to a politically controversial topic, this raises the likelihood of the negative outcome. 
    - Another approach raising the likelihood of the negative outcome is cutting corners and disrespecting other people's work. Reasonable approach to approach this: Be diligent, work proper and give credit where credit is due.
    - Corollary to the corollary: Haters gonna hate. Be prepared for some backlash but see if there's any merit and address it with reason. If there's no merit, there's no merit. Still try to be reasonable.
