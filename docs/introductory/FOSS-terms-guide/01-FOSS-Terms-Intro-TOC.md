# The Open Source domain - What's in it?

## Purpose of this document

This document serves to **level the understanding** between technical (software engineering), non-technical (domain, business) and legal people. The aim is to enable cross-domain collaboration by creating common knowledge and terminology in the working group around open source. 


### How to work with it

Depending on your education and role it might be possible to only skim over certain sections you may have sufficient knowledge in. 
For a software engineer this likely is everything until "3 modes of Open Source".

Important terms in the pre-requisite terms section are marked, hyperlinked and re-used in later sections.

Usage of the "Responsibilities and Expectations" section requires domain and technical term knowledge. 
The terms used in the section "Responsibilities and Expectations" are defined in the sections one and two of this document. 

Should you have questions, proposals for extension or clarification, please provide a pull request, file an issue or add a comment so your input can be addressed and its solution can be present to serve future readers. 


## Structure of this document

This document is separated into individual files based on the individual chapters. Click the links between the chapters to move.

| Section | Title | Description | Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| `1` |[Common Terms](02-FOSS-Terms-Intro-Common-Terms.md) | provides a high-level intuition and **definition of important technical terms** in a least technical explanation. | Beginner |
| `2`| [Three Modes of Open Source](03-FOSS-Terms-Intro-3modes-of-FOSS.md)  | defines the most **common modes of Engagement** seen in Open Source. It provides definitions for and intuition about open source domain-specific terms.| Beginner |
| `3a`|[FOSS licenses](04a-FOSS-Terms-Intro-FOSS-licenses.md) | defines **common use and expectations when using "Open Source licenses" and which areas they govern and which they don't**. **FOSS licenses** represent legally enforceable foundations such as liability limitations and strict, technical conditions for legal use.| Intermediate |
| `3b`|[FOSS governance](04b-FOSS-Terms-Intro-FOSS-governance.md) | **FOSS governance** contains, among other aspects, the "social contract" parts around e.g. what is likely to be accepted, how a way from user to write rights and 'having a say on the future', etc. works. It builds upon the previously defined terms. | Beginner / some intermediate |
|`4`|[Responsibilities and Expectations](05-FOSS-Terms-Intro-responsibilities-and-expectations.md)| helps to set expectations what to expect from Open Source in the narrower sense and what not. <br />**Caveat:** This section is work-in-progress and will need to be extended with the help of various Energinet functions - it is outside of the authors field of knowledge.| Beginner |
|`5`|[Public sector specific considerations and specialities](06-FOSS-Terms-Intro-public-sector-specialties.md)|highlights - as much as they're known - possible **specialties arising from the public sector and TSO environment**. <br />**Caveat:** This section is work-in-progress and will need to be extended with the help of various Energinet functions - it is outside of the authors field of knowledge.| Beginner |

Another guide deals with FOSS strategy. It connects and uses the material of this guide: [FOSS strategy](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/docs/additional_reading/07-FOSS-Terms-Intro-FOSS-strategy.md)

The fourth and fifth section also highlights boundaries between publishers and users/contributors. 
This is important to understand, because it is a common misconception that "Open Source" is solely a license. It is not. It is a mode of engagement, including both the license, a social contract and governance, defining the boundaries between the two roles. 

### Addressing the Action Points

Many **Action Points** are included in this document, especially in the "Responsibilities and Expectations" section.
A practical proposal is to **separate them into individual tasks**, address them sequentially and **store resulting knowledge and decisions as individual files next to this guideline**. It is also recommended to **use the terms in this guideline in the resulting knowledge and decision documents** to enable intersubjective understanding.

### Literature References

This guide frequently references two documents:
- The [Danish Digitalization Agencies' guide on legal aspects of Open Source from 2009](https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/451301/artefact/retligeforholdvedopensource.pdf?artefact=true&PID=464845). It is referred to shortly as **DAP**.
- Our [Energinet "Open Source as TSO" memo](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/docs/additional_reading/legal_memo/legal_memo_README.md). It is referred to shortly as **EnerginetFOSS-memo**. 

Books on the topic:
- Denmark: Possibly [IT-Retten](https://bibliotek.dk/da/work/870970-basis%3A26085950)
  - Denmark: See also the literature appendix of the DAP.

Additional literature is referenced in the individual sections and will be collected in this section too.

## Disclaimer

None of the following content in this or the hyperlinked documents is legal advice or to be interpreted as such. 

The following (i.e. this and any hyperlinked documents) introduces certain aspects of the Open Source (and, based on the work approaches introduced by Open Source, by that InnerSource) domain to further understanding of terms and field.

It raises, without being exhaustive or complete, certain questions around common risk items that are brought up for further legal analysis. Any risk parts, example scenarios, assumptions and definitions are to be interpreted as question around possible risk to be analyzed and cleared up not statement of fact.

It further explains select technical matter in a strongly abstracted and simplified manner. Due to this abstraction, the information may not be suitable to fully decide certain specific legal situations. Detailed technical explanation and analysis is likely to be required in practical application. 

Any examples used are hypothetical and strongly simplified to provide an intuition of the matter explained.

The information is based on experience, common risk items being brought up in a German or US context, as well as information provided by the Danish digitalization agency in the [DAP]((https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/451301/artefact/retligeforholdvedopensource.pdf?artefact=true&PID=464845) document.

It is strictly recommended to seek advice from a FOSS specialized lawyer prior to consuming, deploying, publishing, or participating in Open Source or doing the same with commercial software using or embedding any Open Source component. See also the book referenced in the DAP by **Mads Bryde Andersen: IT- retten**

It is strictly recommended to seek advice from a FOSS specialized lawyer prior to consuming, deploying, publishing, or participating in Open Source or doing the same with commercial software using or embedding any Open Source component.

Authors notice: The consultancy mandate does not include legal advice, FOSS compliance consulting or advice on FOSS publication beyond technical, ways-of-working and common domain expectations. Any further advice, especially of legal nature, implicit or explicit, needs to be sourced from the relevant partners, e.g. a specialized lawyer.
