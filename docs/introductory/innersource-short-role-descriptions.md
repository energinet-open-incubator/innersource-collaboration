## Introduction

InnerSource Commons has defined three distinct roles, that commonly exist in an InnerSource software development community: 

- The Contributor, 
- the Trusted Committer and 
- the Product Owner. 

Each role is defined by certain responsibilities and rules. **A person can fulfill more than one of these roles at the same time.** 

We're using the roles of the InnerSource Commons Foundation here as they are a simplified, condensed version of various similar, common ways of working in Open Source communities that go with a large number of names. 

A short notice on terms: 

- *InnerSource* refers to the use of proven Open Source ways of working on closed, corporate IP behind a corporate boundary (internally). 

- *Open Source* refers to the use of these ways of working on public, worldwide visible code and other intellectual property (IP). It is common that one of the licenses approved by the [OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/#:~:text=Open%20source%20licenses%20are%20licenses%20that%20comply%20with,through%20the%20Open%20Source%20Initiative%E2%80%99s%20license%20review%20process.) or the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) is applied to such material to set clear expectations with regards to allowed and expected use of the public. See the [FOSS Terms Guide] for this.

## Motivation to use Roles
Why do we need defined roles in an open collaboration?

The [InnerSource Commons roles](https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/learning-path/) provide a framework for working together. Having defined roles, will help us building up an open source community in a structured way. We will make sure that someone is assigned specific responsibilities, that are necessary to move the collaboration forward, and to get more people engaged in our project. The InnerSource Commons approach creates a mentoring structure with the Trusted Committers, which will ensure continuous growth and development of contributors, and ensure a validation of the quality of any submitted code. It also adds the ability to potentially evolve contributors into additional Trusted Committers enabling scaling and robustness of the community itself.

## Working Process
What is the working process, using the three roles? 

Very generally, an InnerSource working process is

- A Contributor requests a feature, highlights a bug or a possible improvement they would like to see. It is expected that the contributor will then offer to actually make the change they would like to see themselves â€“ not just request whatever they like hoping that "someone" / "the team" would build it for them.
- The Contributor will then write an issue/user story, which will be discussed with the Trusted Committer, to ensure that what the Contributor wants to build has a high enough chance to get merged due to being of use for the project.  	

- With support and feedback by the Trusted Committer (TC), a first iteration of the  pull request will be submitted by the Contributor, to implement the requested feature. It is then reviewed by the Trusted Committer and iterated between Trusted Committer and Contributor until it is ready for merging. (Or interest in building the PR by the contributor ceases...)

# The Roles
These three short paragraphs give an ultra-short summary of the roles. 
They are not complete or sufficient to operate in such an environment. If you try to operate only on these descriptions without and extensive FOSS / Open Source background you will most likely not be successful for most measures of success.

There is a link to a more extensive [Learning Path](https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/learning-path/) section with videos and articles for all roles but the product owner role below.
You can also look at the [Apache Software Foundation Roles section](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles).

## The Contributor
An individual who submits a contribution in the form of code, documentation or qualified bug/issue reports. The Contributor (the "guest") must conform to the community's (the "host") rules and processes. 
They are active in the open source or an InnerSource community by participating in discussions,  identifying bugs, implementing tests, and providing suggestions and constructive criticism. Contributors benefit from participating in the community, by getting their skills improved through interaction with the community, because the community will make sure that the contributor isn't stuck in a project, by providing feedback and suggestions.   

## The Trusted Committer
The Trusted Committer provides timely support and mentorship for contributors, and helps contributors to shape their pull request (contribution) to be ready to be submitted/accepted.
They are responsible for ensuring product quality, reducing barriers to making contributions, and keeping the community healthy. 
The term *trusted* is important, because the trust and empowerment by the management and the community is necessary to be able to lift their responsibilities. The Trusted Committer should strive to create a welcoming and appreciative environment for their Contributors, that allows them to concentrate on writing software and growing personally, by creating opportunities to learn from other community members

## The Product Owner
The Product Owner role determines which functionalities can be accepted as a contribution. The Product Owner role is responsible for defining and prioritizing requirements and stories for the community to implement. The Product Owner and the Trusted Committer Interact often, to make sure that, for example, a requested or contributed feature actually belongs to the product. 
**Usually until a project grows very large, the Trusted Committer(s) fulfill(s) the role of the Product Owner as well.** This allows them a unique insight between technical feasibility, community dynamics and business value and priorities. Due to this, Trusted Committers need to be highly skilled individuals capable of technical leadership, leadership and good business acumen. As projects and communities grow, the roles might start to separate slowly.
