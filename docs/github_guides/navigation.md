# Navigating in the Project-Origin Github
At a first glance, Github can be quite overwhelming, and in some points unintuitive, when trying to get an overview over a project and its available content. Hence, this Github guide is provided to give you a quick overview of the structures set up on the Project-Origin Github and the different locations you can navigate to.

## Important Github Locations
Project-Origin uses a variety of different features offered by Github in its asynchronous work processes and communication. These features and their use will be described in the following. 

### Communication Channels
Communication happens in several locations in Project-Origin, depending on what the communication revolves around:

- **Issue trackers**: Discussion happens in the individual [Issue](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/origin-collaboration/issues) Where people discuss how to approach specific tasks, features or bugs related to the project.
- **Pull requests**: Someone has committed some work that is in progress as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/origin-collaboration/pulls), where people discuss and review the changes that are in progress.
- **Discussion forums**: The channels provided in the [Discussions](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/origin-collaboration/discussions) are used for conversational topics, such as: "How do I...", or: "What do you think about...", or more informational content that the community as a whole may be interested in. 
- **Synchronous chat channels**: In the [registry](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/registry) the developers additionally use [Slack](https://slack.com/) as a synchronous chat channel, for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.

You can find more information about how to use the different communication channels in the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/origin-collaboration/blob/main/docs/guidelines/contribution_guidelines.md). 

### Documentation 
Project-Origin also has documentation. The best place to look first, is the [Profile README](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/.github-private/blob/main/profile/README.md), which welcomes new community members to the project. 

This repository's README, the _origin-collaboration_ [README](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/origin-collaboration#readme), acts as an instruction manual, that explains how to get started. All the other documentation, referenced in the README, is located in the [docs folder](https://github.com/energinet-open-incubator/origin-collaboration/tree/main/docs) and is mostly guides and reading material (while the [_registry_ repository's documentation](https://project-origin.github.io/registry/) is mostly code documentation).
