## Pull requests
Avoid branch-on-branch-on-branch

-	Try to use very small and short pull requests that describe the change and try to get them in quick.
-	Assuming a FOSS environment, unrelated people will try to understand what a pull request changes. Thus, a good short description (why, what, challenges/open problems, notabenes), meaningful commit messages and a very brief extent allowing meaningful, reasonably quick reviews are a common expectation.
-	One can bind pull requests together with mentioned issues. so they don't loose their coherence.
-	From FOSS experience: Automation with tests or similar automated reviews + master branch protection can help with overseen mishaps.
