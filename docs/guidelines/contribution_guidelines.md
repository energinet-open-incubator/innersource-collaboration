# Origin-Collaboration Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! 
The purpose of this document is to create a common framework, clearly specifying expected behavior when communicating and interacting within the community. 
We’re still working out how to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we’re not quite there yet. 
Hopefully, this document can make the contributing process more clear and answer some questions that you may have.
Hence, these contribution guidelines are best used as a point-of-reference for participants, when in doubt of how or where to make their contribution(s). 

Given that this is a dynamic, evolving project, these guidelines may change over time. 
If you have a specific suggestion for modifying or reformulating something in these guidelines, feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/pulls), containing your suggestion. 

Contributions are welcome in the form of discussion posts, issues, and pull requests here on Github. 
The specific guidelines for each of these communication forms will be described in the following. 


[//]: # (---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------) 

## General Community Guidelines

### 2FA
Participants can only be allowed access to the Origin-Collaboration repository, if they have two-factor authentication activated for their Github account. More information on how to activate two-factor authentication [here](missing-link).

### Choosing between Contribution Options
The most appropriate choice of contribution form, depends on, for one thing, how specific your contribution is. Some general guidelines for when to choose which are:

- Use the Discussion forum, when one of these situations apply to you
  - You don't know where to find something, or how to carry out a certain task on Github
  - You are considering several alternatives for a solution, and it is not clear which one is best
  - You have a loose idea for something, but need inputs for it to become an actual feature to request
  - You have some information that you think is relevant for the community, about related news, something happening, or something you and/or others made in this project.
- Use the Issues, when one of these situations apply to you
  - You have a specific task/list of tasks related to the project, that you want to track, while potentially receiving inputs from the community
  - You have a specific idea for a new feature, but you don't know how to implement it yet, or you want to refine the idea with the Trusted Committer and community before creating a pull request
  - You discovered a bug, and need inputs from the community and trusted committer, before knowing how to fix the bug
- Create a pull request if any of these cases apply:
  - You want to create a new file
  - You want to add a new feature in an existing file
  - You want to modify something specific in an existing file

### Labels
Labels are useful to inform other community members about the topic(s) treated in your issues and pull requests. Further, it allows community members to find any pull requests and issues relevant to them, by using labels for filtering. 

The labels are divided into categories, as provided below, along with an individual description of each label:

- **Green**: Project governance and -collaboration related stuff. Includes labels `shared narrative`, `legal` and `collaboration`.
  - `governance`: Setting up project governance structures or rules
  - `legal`: Deals with legal apects of the project
  - `collaboration`: Related to setting up collaboration structures
  - `shared narrative`: Everything that helps us build our shared narrative
- **Blue**: Product related stuff. Includes labels `documentation`, `product definition` and `enhancement`. 
  - `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
  - `product definition`: Related to our work in defining the individual parts that make up project-origin
  - `enhancement`: New feature or request
- **Purple**: Everything that requires/has required inputs for help. Includes labels `question`, `help wanted` and `good first issue`.
  -  `question`: Further information is requested
  -  `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
  -  `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- **Red**: Everything that isn't working, isn't right or won't be fixed. Includes labels `wont fix`, `bug` and `invalid`.
  - `wont fix`: This will not be worked on
  - `bug`: Something isn't working
  - `invalid`: This does not follow the contribution guidelines
- **Gray**: The more meta and maintaining/structuring kind of stuff. Includes labels `planning`,  `meta`, `housekeeping` and `duplicate`.
  - `planning`: For the purpose of planning
  - `workingsession-notes`: To be assigned on all working session notes pull requests so they can easily be found.
  -  `meta`: Meta content on GitHub org, Organisation etc.
  -  `housekeeping`: Things don't stay tidy themselves. Deals with all things keeping things tidy and neat.
  -  `duplicate`: This issue or pull request already exists
- **Orange**: The identifier for separation of internal Energinet stuff. Includes the label `energinet incubator`.
  - `energinet incubator`: This issue belongs to the overarching Energinet FOSS Skill Incubator topic

## Issues 
Everyone in the community can create issues, using one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/new/choose) provided, or add comments and suggestions to others' issues posted here in the Origin-Collaboration repository. 
Issues are meant for discussing specific, closed-form ideas or details of a project. 

To create an issue in the Origin-Collaboration repository, navigate to the "Issues" tab within the origin-collaboration repository, and click on the green button in the upper right corner, "New Issue", or [click here](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/new/choose). 
Then, a number of issue templates to choose from appears. 

In Github, there are some helping features that apply to all issues, shown and described in the following table.

TODO: TABLE HERE on issue format _Assignees_ , _Labels_, _Projects_, _Milestone_, _Development_

(If you are contributing with specific items related to the issue such as, e.g., markdown-files, images, or PDF's, you can link the pull request(s) containing these items in this section.)

In the Origin-Collaboration repository, it is expected that the contributor at least provides information in the sections "Assignee" and "Labels".

In the following, some information will be provided to help you decide, which issue template best suits what you want to communicate. 


[//]: #  (--------------------------------------------------------------)

### Task 
The Task issue informs the community of a task that you, as a contributor, are working on. 
It helps the community keep up to date with your progress, and creates a space for you to receive inputs and feedback on your task. 

#### _Format_

_Description_

_Motivation_

_Definition of Done_

_Additional Information_

[//]: # (---------------------------------------------------------------) 
              
### Task List
The task list tracks to-do's on the same topic, and hence helps split larger tasks into smaller to-do's. If you are working on several different tasks at the same time, it can also help you collect and track all your tasks at one place. 

_Start Date_
When did/will you start working on this task list? Fill in this field with the Day/Month/Year. 

_Overview_
Fill in this field with a few lines, explanaining the purpose of this task-list.

_To Do_
You add your tasks in this field, by writing "- [ ]" as shown below, and then replacing the placeholders ("Task 1", "Task 2") with the actual tasks that you need to complete. 

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] ...

You can add already existing issues or pull requests to your task list by writing a "#" and following it with the title of the issue/PR. 
When the task list is created, you can convert your tasks to issues, by hovering over them with your mouse and clicking the issue symbol (circle) on the right. 
You can mark a task as complete, by clicking the checkbox that appears in front of the task.

### Feature Request
The Feature Request issue is used for specific ideas and improvement suggestions. 
Everyone from the community can provide inputs to the feature request.
In the spirit of Open Source and InnerSource the focus lies on you as a contributor in doing (most of) the work that you have requested yourself with the supervision and some guidance of the [trusted committer]s once there is enough agreement on the feature.

### Bug Report
A bug report is used to inform the community of an error or problem encountered in the project. It allows the community to discuss the problem, and find potential solutions. It is customary to directly offer your fix for the problem as a pull request for review to facilitate and speed up the solution of the problem. Even if not perfect, this can also advance the discussion by discussing it more specifically.

## Pull requests
Everyone in the community can [create a pull request](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/compare), or add reviews, comments, and suggestions to [existing pull requests](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/pulls). 

Avoid branch-on-branch-on-branch

-	Try to use very small and short pull requests that describe the change and try to get them in quick.
-	Assuming a FOSS environment, unrelated people will try to understand what a pull request changes. Thus, a good short description (why, what, challenges/open problems, notabenes), meaningful commit messages and a very brief extent allowing meaningful, reasonably quick reviews are a common expectation.
-	One can bind pull requests together with mentioned issues. so they don't loose their coherence.
-	From FOSS experience: Automation with tests or similar automated reviews + master branch protection can help with overseen mishaps.
