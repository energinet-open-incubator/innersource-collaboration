# Origin-Collaboration Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! 
The purpose of this document is to create a common framework, clearly specifying expected behavior when communicating and interacting within the community. 
We’re still working out how to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we’re not quite there yet. 
Hopefully, this document can make the contributing process more clear and answer some questions that you may have.
Hence, these contribution guidelines are best used as a point-of-reference for participants, when in doubt of how or where to make their contribution(s). 


Given that this is a dynamic, evolving project, these guidelines may change over time. 
If you have a specific suggestion for modifying or reformulating something in these guidelines, feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/pulls), containing your suggestion. 

Contributions are welcome in the form of discussion posts, issues, and pull requests here on Github. 
The specific guidelines for each of these communication forms will be described in the following. 


[//]: # (---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------) 

## Issues 
Everyone in the community can create issues, using one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/new/choose) provided, or add comments and suggestions to others' issues posted here in the Origin-Collaboration repository. 
Issues are meant for discussing specific, closed-form ideas or details of a project. 

To create an issue in the Origin-Collaboration repository, navigate to the "Issues" tab within the origin-collaboration repository, and click on the green button in the upper right corner, "New Issue", or [click here](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/new/choose). 
Then, a number of issue templates to choose from appears. 

In Github, there are some helping features that apply to all issues, shown and described in the following table.

TODO: TABLE HERE on issue format _Assignees_ , _Labels_, _Projects_, _Milestone_, _Development_

(If you are contributing with specific items related to the issue such as, e.g., markdown-files, images, or PDF's, you can link the pull request(s) containing these items in this section.)

In the Origin-Collaboration repository, it is expected that the contributor at least provides information in the sections "Assignee" and "Labels".

In the following, some information will be provided to help you decide, which issue template best suits what you want to communicate.

### Task 
The Task issue informs the community of a task that you, as a contributor, are working on. 
It helps the community keep up to date with your progress, and creates a space for you to receive inputs and feedback on your task.

_Motivation_

_Definition of Done_

### Feature Request
The Feature Request issue is used for specific ideas and improvement suggestions. 
Everyone from the community can provide inputs to the feature request.
In the spirit of Open Source and InnerSource the focus lies on you as a contributor in doing (most of) the work that you have requested yourself with the supervision and some guidance of the [trusted committer]s once there is enough agreement on the feature.

### Bug Report
A bug report is used to inform the community of an error or problem encountered in the project. It allows the community to discuss the problem, and find potential solutions. It is customary to directly offer your fix for the problem as a pull request for review to facilitate and speed up the solution of the problem. Even if not perfect, this can also advance the discussion by discussing it more specifically.

## Pull requests
Everyone in the community can [create a pull request](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/compare), or add reviews, comments, and suggestions to [existing pull requests](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/pulls). 

Avoid branch-on-branch-on-branch

-	Try to use very small and short pull requests that describe the change and try to get them in quick.
-	Assuming a FOSS environment, unrelated people will try to understand what a pull request changes. Thus, a good short description (why, what, challenges/open problems, notabenes), meaningful commit messages and a very brief extent allowing meaningful, reasonably quick reviews are a common expectation.
-	One can bind pull requests together with mentioned issues. so they don't loose their coherence.
-	From FOSS experience: Automation with tests or similar automated reviews + master branch protection can help with overseen mishaps.

## Discussions
