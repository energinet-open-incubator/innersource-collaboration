# Origin-Collaboration Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! 
The purpose of this document is to create a common framework, clearly specifying expected behavior when communicating and interacting within the community. 
We’re still working out how to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we’re not quite there yet. 
Hopefully, this document can make the contributing process more clear and answer some questions that you may have.
Hence, these contribution guidelines are best used as a point-of-reference for participants, when in doubt of how or where to make their contribution(s). 

Given that this is a dynamic, evolving project, these guidelines may change over time. 
If you have a specific suggestion for modifying or reformulating something in these guidelines, feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/pulls), containing your suggestion. 

There are some general rules that apply to everyone who wants to contribute to the Origin-Collaboration repository. 
These will be described in the first part of this document. 
Contributions are welcome in the form of discussion posts, issues, and pull requests. 
The specific guidelines for each of these communication forms will be described in the following. 


[//]: # (---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------) 

## General Community Guidelines

### 2FA
Participants can only be allowed access to the Origin-Collaboration repository, if they have two-factor authentication activated for their Github account. More information on how to activate two-factor authentication [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

### Labels
Labels are useful to inform other community members about the topic(s) treated in your issues and pull requests. Further, it allows community members to find any pull requests and issues relevant to them, by using labels for filtering. 

The labels are divided into categories, as provided below, along with an individual description of each label:

- **Green**: Project governance and -collaboration related stuff. Includes labels `shared narrative`, `legal` and `collaboration`.
  - `governance`: Setting up project governance structures or rules
  - `legal`: Deals with legal apects of the project
  - `collaboration`: Related to setting up collaboration structures
  - `shared narrative`: Everything that helps us build our shared narrative
- **Blue**: Product related stuff. Includes labels `documentation`, `product definition` and `enhancement`. 
  - `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
  - `product definition`: Related to our work in defining the individual parts that make up project-origin
  - `enhancement`: New feature or request
- **Purple**: Everything that requires/has required inputs for help. Includes labels `question`, `help wanted` and `good first issue`.
  -  `question`: Further information is requested
  -  `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
  -  `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- **Red**: Everything that isn't working, isn't right or won't be fixed. Includes labels `wont fix`, `bug` and `invalid`.
  - `wont fix`: This will not be worked on
  - `bug`: Something isn't working
  - `invalid`: This does not follow the contribution guidelines
- **Gray**: The more meta and maintaining/structuring kind of stuff. Includes labels `planning`,  `meta`, `housekeeping` and `duplicate`.
  - `planning`: For the purpose of planning
  - `workingsession-notes`: To be assigned on all working session notes pull requests so they can easily be found.
  -  `meta`: Meta content on GitHub org, Organisation etc.
  -  `housekeeping`: Things don't stay tidy themselves. Deals with all things keeping things tidy and neat.
  -  `duplicate`: This issue or pull request already exists
- **Orange**: The identifier for separation of internal Energinet stuff. Includes the label `energinet incubator`.
  - `energinet incubator`: This issue belongs to the overarching Energinet FOSS Skill Incubator topic

## Choosing between Contribution Options
The most appropriate choice of contribution form, depends on, for one thing, how specific your contribution is. Some general guidelines for when to choose which are:

- Use the Discussion forum, when one of these situations apply to you
  - You don't know where to find something, or how to carry out a certain task on Github
  - You are considering several alternatives for a solution, and it is not clear which one is best
  - You have a loose idea for something, but need inputs for it to become an actual feature to request
  - You have some information that you think is relevant for the community, about related news, something happening, or something you and/or others made in this project.
- Use the Issues, when one of these situations apply to you
  - You have a specific task/list of tasks related to the project, that you want to track, while potentially receiving inputs from the community
  - You have a specific idea for a new feature, but you don't know how to implement it yet, or you want to refine the idea with the Trusted Committer and community before creating a pull request
  - You discovered a bug, and need inputs from the community and trusted committer, before knowing how to fix the bug
- Create a pull request if any of these cases apply:
  - You want to create a new file
  - You want to add something to an existing file
  - You want to modify something specific in an existing file


[//]: # (---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------) 

## Issues 
Everyone in the community can create issues, using one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/new/choose) provided, or add comments and suggestions to others' issues posted here in the Origin-Collaboration repository. 
Issues are meant for discussing specific, closed-form ideas or details of a project. 

To create an issue in the Origin-Collaboration repository, navigate to the "Issues" tab within the origin-collaboration repository, and click on the green button in the upper right corner, "New Issue", or [click here](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/issues/new/choose). 
Then, a number of issue templates to choose from appears. 

**TODO: image here issue templates**

In Github, there are some helping features that apply to all issues, shown and described in the following table.

**TODO: TABLE HERE on issue format _Assignees_ , _Labels_, _Projects_, _Milestone_, _Development_**

(If you are contributing with specific items related to the issue such as, e.g., markdown-files, images, or PDF's, you can link the pull request(s) containing these items in this section.)

In the Origin-Collaboration repository, it is expected that the contributor at least provides information in the sections "Assignee" and "Labels". A list of the labels used in this repository is provided [here](#labels).

In the following, some information will be provided to help you decide, which issue template best suits what you want to communicate. 



### Task 
The Task issue informs the community of a task that you, as a contributor, are working on. 
It helps the community keep up to date with your progress, and creates a space for you to receive inputs and feedback on your task. 

#### _Format_

_Title_:
Leave the "✏️ [TASK]" part of the title, and fill in a concise title at "<title>" that describes the task.

_Start Date_: 
When did/will you start working on this task? Fill in this field with the Day/Month/Year. 

_Description_:
Briefly describe the task you are working on in this field. 

_Motivation_:
Describe why this task needs to be done. Which value does the task provide to the project or community? 

_Definition of Done_:
Describe what needs to happen before the task can be considered done. Some examples on what to provide here is:

- Do you need specific inputs from someone/the community? 
- Does a certain number of steps need to be completed? 
- Are changes to certain access rights necessary? 

_Additional Information_:
Add something here, if you have some background information you want people to know, or if there are related issues or pull requests related to the task. 


              
### Task List
The task list tracks to-do's on the same topic, and hence helps split larger tasks into smaller to-do's. If you are working on several different tasks at the same time, it can also help you collect and track all your tasks at one place. 

#### _Format_ 

_Title_: 
Leave the "☑️ [TASK LIST]" part of the title, and fill in a concise title at "<title>" that describes the task list. 
An example could be "☑️ [TASK LIST] - Laura's personal task tracker, February 2023".

_Start Date_: 
When did/will you start working on this task list? Fill in this field with the Day/Month/Year. 

_Overview_: 
Fill in this field with a few lines, explanaining the purpose of this task-list.

_To Do_: 
You add your tasks in this field, by writing "- [ ]" as shown below, and then replacing the placeholders ("Task 1", "Task 2") with the actual tasks that you need to complete. 

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] ...

You can add already existing issues or pull requests to your task list by writing a "#" and following it with the title of the issue/PR. 
When the task list is created, you can convert your tasks to issues, by hovering over them with your mouse and clicking the issue symbol (circle) on the right. 
You can mark a task as complete, by clicking the checkbox that appears in front of the task.

_Comments/Unresolved questions_:
If there are any related questions that still remain unresolved, or there is something else important to note, you can add it here. 



### Feature Request
The Feature Request issue is used for specific ideas and improvement suggestions. 
Everyone from the community can provide inputs to the feature request.
In the spirit of Open Source and InnerSource the focus lies on you as a contributor in doing (most of) the work that you have requested yourself with the supervision and some guidance of the [trusted committer]s once there is enough agreement on the feature.

#### _Format_ 

_Title_: 
Leave the "💡 [REQUEST]" part of the title, and fill in a concise title at "<title>" that describes the feature you want to implement. 

_Start Date_: 
When did/will you start working on this feature request? Fill in this field with the Day/Month/Year. 

_Implementation PR_: 
If you have started implementing something on Github, add the relevant pull request here.

_Reference issues_: 
If other issues in the repository are related to your feature request, you should link it here. 

_Summary_: 
Provide a brief explanation of what the feature you want to implement is about.

_Basic Example_: 
Fill in an example of a situation, where your feature will be useful.

_Drawbacks_: 
Fill in any negative impacts caused by your feature in this field. 

_Unresolved Questions_: 
If there are some elements related to your feature that are still unclear, you should describe those elements here. Additionally, you should label your issue with `help wanted` to let the community know that something needs inputs and/or processing. 



### Bug Report
A bug report is used to inform the community of an error or problem encountered in the project. It allows the community to discuss the problem, and find potential solutions. It is customary to directly offer your fix for the problem as a pull request for review to facilitate and speed up the solution of the problem. Even if not perfect, this can also advance the discussion by discussing it more specifically.

#### _Format_ 

_Title_: 
Leave the "🐞 [BUG]" part of the title, and fill in a concise line describing the bug at "<title>".

_To Reproduce_:
Write down a step-by-step walkthrough of how you found/encountered the error, including a description of the error, in the last step.

_Expected Behavior_:
Describe what you expected to happen instead of the error you encountered.

_Screenshots_: 
If applicable, you can add screenshots of the error encountered here. 

_Desktop_: 
In this field, you should write down your computers operating system (e.g., iOS, Windows), the browser you used (e.g., Safari, Edge) and the version of your operating system and browser. If the bug does not involve access through a browser, you can state "not applicable" if there is none.

_Additional Context_:
Of there is any additional, relevant information about the bug you encountered, you can add it here. 


 
[//]: # (--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------)

## Pull requests
Everyone in the community can create a pull request, or add reviews, comments, and suggestions to [existing pull requests](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/pulls). 

### Create a pull request
If you want to create a new file, or you want to add/modify something in an existing file, you must create a pull request. To do so you must either:

1. Navigate to a relevant location for your new file, and click on "Add file" and then "Create new file" in the drop-down menu. Give the file a title (remember to add ".md" if you want to create a Markdown file), and fill in the file with your content. 

**TODO: Add image create new file**

2. Navigate to the [pull request templates](link-here) and find a relevant template for your pull request. This is relevant if you want to create 1. an [RFC](link-here), 2. a [meeting minutes], or 3. others?.

  i. Click on the pull request template you want to use
  ii. Click on the "Copy raw contents" symbol
  iii. Navigate to a relevant location for your file, click on "Add file" and then "Create new file" in the drop-down menu. 
  iv. Left-click in the new file and choose "paste" in the drop-down menu, or press ctrl+V to paste the template. 
  v. Fill in the template with your content 
 
3. Navigate to the location of the file you want to modify, click on the file, and then click on the "✏️" in the upper right corner of the file. 

**TODO: Add image**


### Guidelines

#### Commit Message
The commit message must be filled with the following information: 

_Description of the change(s) made_ 
Briefly describe the changes you have made, whether it is a new file proposed, or additions/changes to an existing document. Try to capture the changes in a few short, concise sentences that are easy to grasp, but still describes the changes in a sufficiently specific way. 

_Reason for suggested change(s)_
Describe the problem that the changes mitigate, or the goal that the change helps achieve. 

_How did you implement the change(s)?_
If applicable, provide some information about your methods for creating the new file or changes. 

_Additional information_
Provide any other related and/or relevant information here. This could be some background information, or a related issue, pull request or discussion.

#### Commit Settings
You must always create a new branch for your pull request. 
Hence, when submitting it, select the setting "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". When you create a separate branch, you isolate your work without affecting other branches in the repository.

Potentially edit the branch name, to help the rest of the community easily understand what the branch contains.

#### Best Practices
There are a number of best practices, which will help ensure that the path towards merging your contribution runs smoothly: 

-	Try to use very small and short pull requests that describe the change in an easy-to-grasp way, to increase the chance of quick merging times.
-	Unrelated people will try to understand what your pull request changes. Thus, providing meaningful and brief commit messages allows for meaningful, reasonably quick reviews
- It is expected that the contributor at least provides information in the sections "Assignee" and "Labels". A list of the labels used in this repository is provided [here](#labels)
- If you want someone specific to review your pull request, you can add them in the "Reviewers" section

### Pull Request Templates
**TODO: Make templates**
The Origin-Collaboration repository has a number of [pull request templates](link-here) for documents with certain requirements for their structures. These templates will be described individually below. 

#### Request for Comments (RFC)
Requests for Comments (RFCs) can be submitted in the Origin-Collaboration repository, to make bigger, more extensive change proposals which will affect Project-Origin both on the technical and business aspects. 
The RFC must contain the following information:

_Title_:
Leave the "📬 [RFC]000" part of the title, and fill in a title at "<title>" that encompasses the suggestion provided in the RFC. The number "000" illustrates the status of the RFC, and means that it has the status "draft". The RFC will change status over time, as it is treated by the community and the [Trusted Committer]() of the Origin-Collaboration repository. The RFC can be assigned one of the following statusses:

**TODO: Create table statusses and descriptions of how to reach it**

_Summary_: 
Summarize in 1-2 sentences problem adressed, and the suggested solution.

_Context_:
This field should be filled in with some background information answering:

- Where does the problem exist?
- What are the pre-conditions?

_Problem_: 
Fill in this field with challenges and/or issues that the suggested change addresses. This section should adress:

- What makes the problem difficult?
- What are the trade-offs?

_Rationale_:
This field should contain information that explains _why_ this is the right solution. Optionally, fill in some information about alternative solutions, and why they were discarded. 

_Implications_: 
Describe which implications the proposal will have on Project-Origin, if your proposal is accepted. 

_Additional Information_: 
Add any relevant, additional information in this field. It could be, e.g., examples of known instances of you proposed solution in other business/contexts, or any co-authors of the proposal besides yourself. 

#### Meeting Minutes 
The meeting minutes template is used, when a working group in the partnership carries out meetings, to make sure that important points from the meeting are recorded and shared with the rest of the community. The template is created using the [InnerSource meeting template](link-here) as inspiration. The meeting minutes contain the following fields: 

_Title_: 
The defalt title is "Project Origin Working Group Meeting DD, MM, YYYY", which should be modified to contain the meeting date. 

_Roles_: 
To ensure that the meeting runs smoothly, three meeting participants will be assigned with a role beforehand:
- Scheduler
  - The scheduler is responsible for creating the meeting minutes document, prepare an agenda, and send a calendar invite to the rest of the meeting attendees.
- Facilitator
  - The facilitator conducts the meeting and makes sure that all of the agenda items are finished within the allotted time.
- Scribe
  - The scribe writes down key points during the meeting by adding them to the meeting minutes pull request, that the scheduler created. 
  
More information about the three roles is provided [here](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/meetings/meeting_docs/roles.md). 

_Agenda_: 
This part of the document must be filled in with agenda points to go through in the meeting. Some suggested agenda points are added to the template, but can be modified as the scheduler sees fit. 

_Notes_: 
This section is for the scribe to fill in with the points: 
- Attendees
  - Should be filled in with names and Github usernames of the meeting's participants.
- Key points
  - Records main elements discussed in the meeting, and the outcome of the discussions. 
- Assignments 
  - If meeting participants agree on some assignments to do, they can be recorded here.
- Next meeting's roles
  - If the meeting is part of a recurring series of meetings, the participants can agree on someone to fill in the three roles for the next meeting.

## Project Boards
Describing the three project boards. 

### General guidelines
How to use the boards. When to move the issues to another status column. 

### Using Draft issues 
Using the draft issues feature. To inform the community of certain work that needs to be done, but that is not further defined, and that you haven't started working on yet. It is highly encouraged to use the discussions forum instead, for ideas that need to be refined.  

 
[//]: # (---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------) 

## Discussions
[Discussions](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/discussions) are intended for open-form ideas or topics, and creates a space for the community to interact and communicate more broadly than is possible in the more closed-form issues and pull requests. 

... potentially creating issues and pull requests for ideas that sees a large connect from the community and evolves to a more definite feature. If a specific discussion has been especially valuable for the arguments exchanged or the options discarded etc. or a specific good formulation is present feel free to link to said comment or discussion in the pull request. Such written discussion artifacts are considered passive documentation and reduce writing burden and can reduce disconnection from the past leading to history repeating.

### General
A forum for open, informal discussion in the community.

### Announcements
Can be used to announce, e.g., any decisions made in the partnership, or any major feature or progress that has been made, that affects the community.
 
### Ideas
If you have an idea for something, but you don’t know exactly if or how to implement it, you can post your idea in the Ideas discussion forum (link here). This discussion channel gives the community a place to discuss loose, open ideas, and potentially develop an idea until it becomes a well-defined feature request. If an idea evolves to a feature request, an issue can be created for this.

### Polls
Polls will be posted in the Discussion forum. The decision-making in polls follows a lazy consensus approach, inspired by the Apache definition of the concept. A poll can have a status of proposed, open or closed. When a poll is closed, the outcome of the vote indicated in the poll can be considered as decided on. See more information about the decision-making process of polls in the [Decision-Making Policy](https://github.com/project-origin/origin-collaboration/blob/main/docs/guidelines/decision_making_policy.md). 

### Q & A
Q&A creates a space for the community to ask each other questions, and support each other on specific problems.

### Show and Tell
A place to highlight and praise contributions that you, or someone else have made.
