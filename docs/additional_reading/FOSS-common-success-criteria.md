## Introduction 

Success in FOSS can have different signs, very dependent on what you want to achieve.
However, there are some common signs that show adoption of FOSS. 
The list isn't complete, perfectly precise not necessarily quantitative, but it is based on practical experience.

You can track the **absolute number and 1st derivation**, i.e. growth rate of any of the following.

## GitHub 
Or another common large code hosting platform.

- GitHub "stars"
- GitHub forks
 - Might be two-sided as another fork may become more active or dominant than your project. While this highlights that your original contribution was good, it could also make it "their" project now or indicate issues with your community because people rather work there than with you.
- Issues being written
 - Reasonably fast reaction times on your side are relevant here.
 - You can help with templates to prevent clueless/unqualified issues
 - Even a "make this for me, you're doing free work don't you?" indicates interest...Maybe not directly what you wanted, but...
- Code contribution
 - Generally a sign of your product being used by someone and of high enough value for them to bring things back to you. Celebrate!
 - Reaction time and qualified response are key here.
- Discussions

- You get questions, contributions, etc. on your documentation assets such as contribution documentation, real docs, code...

## Media coverage
- People write about your product in blogs, on social media you hear about it in discussions 
 - Congrats, celebrate. That's users.  
 - Might be a good way still to engage them further than user towards contributor (even with issues)
  - The usual FOSS funnel loses an order of magnitude of people on every step of the funnel. (Not scientifically accurate, but not really wrong either...)

## Participation in (Semi-)Sync media
- People show up to community calls or work sessions. 
 - Celebrate and welcome everyone of them.
 - You can even just open your regular work meetings, publish their location and people might show up if you made something valuable to them.
 - You get interactions and sign-ups for half-sync/async channels such as Slack
 - Your [Trusted Committer]s or other percieved influential people getting emailed or 1:1 approached.

Of course people copying your approach (copycats) or trying to jump on your buzz bandwagon by branding their unrelated whatever-thingamaybeit with your terms is a safe sign of success. 

That will then start the real work for you then though...
